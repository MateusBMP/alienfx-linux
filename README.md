# AlienFX-linux

Ported version of [AlienFX](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools) for Linux, which gives
complete light support for most of the device dell produce.

Check out `Example-App/` for a sample application.
All testing applications are located in `alienfx-cli/` folder.

Tested on linux:

- Alienware elc (g-series,alienware m series)
- Darfon (alienware series)

## AlienFan-SDK

Library for controlling fans and sensors of Alienware hardware.

### Supported devices:

Any Alienware/Dell G-series hardware from 2010 to 2025.

## AlienFX-SDK

Better AlienFX/LightFX SDK than Dell official's one without any limitations:

- Better performance. Update rate can be very high for modern devices.
- Tiny footprint both in code and RAM.
- Full hardware features support - per-key and per-device effect set, hardware brightness, hardware power buttons.
- Using direct hardware access, so no additional software required.

### Supported devices:

Any Alienware/Dell G-series hardware with RGB lights from 2010 to 2025. Including mouses, keyboards, monitors.
Read more details about supported devices and models [here](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools/wiki/Supported-and-tested-devices-list)

### Supported device API versions:

- ~~ACPI-controlled lights - 3 lights, 8 bit/color (v0) - Aurora R6/R7 (using this API require AlienFan-SDK library from [AlienFX-Tools](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools) project).~~ Not Planned
- 9 bytes 8 bit/color, reportID 2 control (v1) - Ancient notebooks - deprecated and removed.
- 9 bytes 4 bit/color, reportID 2 control (v2) - Older notebooks (like m14/17x, 13R1/R2)
- 12 bytes 8 bit/color, reportID 2 control (v3) - Old notebooks (like 15R5)
- 34 bytes 8 bit/color, reportID 0 control (v4) - Modern notebooks/desktop (all m-series, x-series, Dell g-series, Aurora R8+)
- 64 bytes 8 bit/color, featureID 0xcc control (v5) - Modern notebooks internal per-key RGB keyboard (all m- and x-series)
- 65 bytes 8 bit/color, interrupt control (v6) - Mouses
- 65 bytes 8 bit/color, featureID control (v7) - Monitors
- 65 bytes 8 bit/color, Interrupt control (v8) - External keyboards

Check compatibility list and API details [here](https://github.com/T-Troll/alienfx-tools/wiki/Supported-and-tested-devices-list).

Some notebooks can have 2 devices - APIv4 (for logo, power button, etc) and APIv5 for keyboard.

### Supported hardware features:

- Multiply devices detection and handling
- User-provided device, light or group (zone) names
- Change light color
- Change multiply lights color
- Change light hardware effect (except APIv0 and v5)
- Change multiply lights hardware effects (except APIv0 and APIv5)
- Hardware-backed global light off/on/dim (dim is software for v6 and should be done by application)
- Global (all lights) hardware light effects (APIv5, v8)
- Power/indicator button light control (AC/battery hardware switch and effects)

## Dependencies

- cmake
- ninja

## Build

```bash
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake .. -G Ninja -DALIENFX_BUILD_CLI=ON -DALIENFX_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON #OPTIONAL -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
ninja
```

It would build 3 executables:

- `AlienFX-SDK` - static library with AlienFX SDK
- `alienfx-cli` - command line tool for testing and configuring lights
- `Example-App` - sample application

### UPDATES

#### UPDATE (#1)

For now if u want to configure any device you have to run `HOME=/home/username sudo ./alienfx_cli probe` And configure + probe all ur device (this time it would save it to config files

Once done u can see ur devices by running `./alienfx_cli status` which would output

````
Device #0 - Alienware AW-ELC, VID#6268, PID#1361, APIv4, 4 lights
  Light ID#0 - Left
  Light ID#1 - Middle Left
  Light ID#2 - Middle Right
  Light ID#3 - Right
More devices in ur case
````

And then u can use any of the function of alienfx-cli
Example: To set all lights to red i would do `./alienfx_cli setall 255 0 0` and every light would be red


Currently all device in windows version are supported (except some acpi device)


#### UPDATE (#2)

Added Create Zone command `createlightzone` its intractive

Now u can create ur custom zone of any light type

Example:

 I wanna make WASD key change colour together i can create a zone and then directly change color of that zone

```

#### UPDATE (#3)
